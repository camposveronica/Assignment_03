/*Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself? Write a function named tellFortune() that:
•	Takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
•	Outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
•	Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.
